## Info

## My Research

Tried to imporve the performance by combining with ASNet.

Problems:
- AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_inbound_nodes'
- ValueError: Output tensors to a Model must be the output of a Keras `Layer` (thus holding past layer metadata). Found: Tensor("resize/ResizeBilinear:0", shape=(1, 14, 14, 1), dtype=float32)
